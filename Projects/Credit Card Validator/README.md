## Credit Card Validator

This tool checks the validity and type of any specified credit card number. Not all credit card types/names are supported, so I suppose that it would not be very practical and wise to use this tool productively.

I did not attempt to capture or store any credit card info, but you should not enter your own credit card info in this app or any other third party app. Instead, use the sample credit card numbers provided by a bank which can be found [here](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_AU/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm).
